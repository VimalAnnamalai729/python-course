"""
ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATION USING PIPE
The Pipe object provides a two-way communication channel between two processes.

WHEN TO USE PIPE:
=================
    * Point-to-Point Communication:

        Use Pipe when there are only two processes that need to communicate directly.
        Example: A process sends commands to a child process and receives responses.
    * Simpler Communication:

        If the communication is straightforward, such as passing a few messages between two processes, Pipe is more efficient than Queue.
        Example: Sending a "start/stop" signal to a worker process.
    * Lower Overhead:

        Pipe is faster and has less overhead than Queue because it doesnâ€™t involve a complex data structure.
        Example: Lightweight communication for high-speed message passing between two processes.
    * Two-Way Communication:

        The Pipe can act as a full-duplex channel where both processes can send and receive data.
